            <h3>This Is Us</h3>
            <p>We are a family of 5, with 3 pets. <br> My name is Brittz, and my boyfriends name is Colton. <br> We have
                3
                children total. Rhydon is the oldest, at 4 years old. Everlie is 2, and Xaq is also 2 years old. They
                have
                birthdays about a month apart of each other.<br>Then between Colton and I, we have 3 pets at the moment.
                I
                have
                Nikola, and Colton has Daisy and Pax. <br> We plan to have us all mix together under one roof soon!
